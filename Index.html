<h3>This Is Why The Yankees Are My Favorite Team</h3>
I have been a sports fan for pretty much all of my life beginning with being a New York Rangers (professional hockey team) fan in 2013. I have been a Yankees fan since 2016. I experienced the rise of Aaron Judge into his perennial MVP self that he is now. I saw them reach the World Series for the first time since 2009, when they made it last year in 2024. I saw their lows, missing the playoffs and getting swept by the Astros in the ALCS as well as losing in game 7 against the cheating ass Houston Astros in 2019. Anyways, the Yankees have some of my favorite baseball players playing for them and they are based in New York which is where I am from. These are some of the reasons why the New York Yankees are my favorite baseball team.
